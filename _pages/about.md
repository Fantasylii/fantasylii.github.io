# ü§µüèª About me
I am a Master's student at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. Shengyu Zhang, and currently a Technical Staff Intern at InfiX.ai. My research focuses on efficient multimodal large language models (MLLMs), knowledge migration across heterogeneous architectures, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for edge devices.
